### Pyramid of Numbers

#### Overview

Write a program that creates a pyramid of numbers.

#### Setup

* Create a class (<code>.java</code>) file called <code>Pyramid.java</code>
* (This can be within a project that contains the other parts of this homework or it can be in separate project on its own)

#### Features

* Ask the user for a number
	* Expect the input to be a positive integer
	* (You do not have to account for any input)
* Generate a pyramid made of numbers based on user input ... 
	* Mimic the pyramid in the example output below
	* Ensure that the spacing between each number is consistent
	
#### Example Output

### Problem 6.31 in 10th Edition of {{site.book}}: Credit Card Number Validation
 
#### Overview

__Directly from the book, problem 6.31...__

(Financial: credit card number validation) Credit card numbers follow certain patterns. A credit card number must have between 13 and 16 digits. It must start with:

* 4 for Visa cards
* 5 for Master cards
* 37 for American Express cards
* 6 for Discover cards

In 1954, Hans Luhn of IBM proposed an algorithm for validating credit card numbers. The algorithm is useful to determine whether a card number is entered correctly or whether a credit card is scanned correctly by a scanner. Credit card numbers are generated following this validity check, commonly known as the Luhn check or the Mod 10 check, which can be described as follows (for illustration, consider the card number 4388576018402626):

1. Double every second digit from right to left. If doubling of a digit results in a two-digit number, add up the two digits to get a single-digit number. (See figure below)
2. Now add all single-digit numbers from Step 1.  <code>4 + 4 + 8 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 8 = 37</code>
3. Add all digits in the odd places from right to left in the card number. <code>6 + 6 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 7 + 8 + 3 = 38</code>
4. Sum the results from Step 2 and Step 3.  <code>37 + 38 = 75</code>
5. If the result from Step 4 is divisible by 10, the card number is valid; otherwise, it is invalid. For example, the number 4388576018402626 is invalid, but the number 4388576018410707 is valid.

![luhn](../resources/img/luhn.png)

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a credit card number as a long integer. Display whether the number is valid or invalid. Design your program to use the following methods:

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
/** Return true if the card number is valid */
public static boolean isValid(long number) 

/** Get the result from Step 2 */
public static int sumOfDoubleEvenPlace(long number)

/** Return this number if it is a single digit, otherwise,
 * return the sum of the two digits */
public static int getDigit(int number)

/** Return sum of odd-place digits in number */
public static int sumOfOddPlace(long number)

/** Return true if the digit d is a prefix for number */
public static boolean prefixMatched(long number, int d) /** Return the number of digits in d */
public static int getSize(long d)

/** Return the first k number of digits from number. If the
 * number of digits in number is less than k, return number. */
public static long getPrefix(long number, int k)

</code></pre>
<!--* -->

#### Setup

* Create a class (<code>.java</code>) file called <code>CreditCard.java</code>
* (This can be within a project that contains the other parts of this homework or it can be in separate project on its own)

#### Example Output

Here are sample runs of the program: (You may also implement this program by reading the input as a string and processing the string to validate the credit card.)

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>Enter a credit card number as a long integer:
> 4388576018410707
4388576018410707 is valid
</code></pre>

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>Enter a credit card number as a long integer:
> 4388576018402626
4388576018402626 is invalid
</code></pre>

### Array Utility Methods

#### Overview

Write the Array utility methods specified below. They include simulating Python's range function, Array concatenation, etc.

Note that __if there is an equivalent built-in method in Java__, you cannot use it. For example, there is a <code>toString</code> method in <code>java.utils.Arrays</code>. You cannot use that method when implementing your own version of <code>toString</code>!

* (5 points)<code>toString(int[] arr)</code>
* (1 point) <code>prettyPrint(int[] arr)</code>
* (6 points) <code>randomInts(int size, int minVal, int maxVal)</code>
* (7 points) <code>range(int start, int stop, int step)</code>
* (1 point) <code>range(int start, int stop)</code>
* (1 point) <code>range(int stop)</code>
* (5 points) <code>concat(int[] arr1, int[] arr2)</code>
* (5 points) <code>subArray(int[] arr, int index)</code>
* (4 points) <code>average(int[] arr)</code>

#### Setup

* Create a class (<code>.java</code>) file called <code>ArrayUtils.java</code>
* (This can be within a project that contains the other parts of this homework or it can be in separate project on its own)
#### Features

Use the method headers and documentation below for your implementation. Test your implementation using the test cases at the end (you can drop these test cases in main).

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>

### Pig Dice Game

#### Overview

Pig is a dice game where:

* each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until they roll a 1 or choose to "hold"
	* if a 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing for that turn and the next player goes...
	* if the player rolls any other number, that numbers is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues
	* if the player chooses to "hold" their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn
* the player that reaches 100 or more points first wins

[Read the wikipedia article on it!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_%28dice_game%29)

#### Setup

* Create a class (<code>.java</code>) file called <code>Pig.java</code>
* (This can be within a project that contains the other parts of this homework or it can be in separate project on its own)

#### Features

* there are two players, the user and the computer
* the game continues until either player scores 100
* the game proceeds with the user taking their turn first, followed by the computer
* the score for both players is displayed after both take their turns
* during a turn, a player can (note that the computer player will automatically choose):
	* (r)oll to continue rolling
		* this rolls a six sided die, with the roll displayed
		* if the roll is not 1 
			* the roll is added to their turn total
			* the current turn total is displayed if the player is the user (not the computer)
		* if the roll is 1, then their turn total is 0, and their turn ends
	* (h)old to end their turn
		* the player's turn ends
	* (q)uit to quit (user only)
		* the game ends immediately
* add the end of each player's turn
	* the player's new turn total should be added to their score
	* the player's roll total should be displayed
	* the player's new score should be displayed
* create at least one method in your program
	* the method should determine the computer's action (roll or hold) 
	* the action should be based on the computer's current turn total and the opponent's score (these should be parameters in your method)
	* if the computer's turn total is 20, hold (why risk losing 20 points!)
	* however... if the other player is close to winning - within 10, go for broke! ... roll even if you have more than 20 points for the turn)



#### Example Output:

__First 4 turns:__

1. player scores 11 and holds
2. computer scores 0 (rolls a 1 on third roll)
3. player scores 3
4. computer scores 23
