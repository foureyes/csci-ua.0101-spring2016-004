### Four in a Row

#### Overview

Write a method called <code>checkFour</code>... that determines whether there are four consecutive elements in a row, in a column or diagonally, in a matrix of integers.

#### Setup

* Create a class (<code>.java</code>) file called <code>FourInARow.java</code>
* (This can be within a project that contains the other parts of this homework or it can be in separate project on its own)

#### Features

Implement the following:

* A method: <code>public static int checkFour(int[][] board, int piece)</code>
	* <code>board</code> is a two-dimensional Array of integers
	* <code>piece</code> an integer to search for
	* returns the integer if it occurs 4 times consecutively in a row, column or diagonally
	* returns -1 if the integer specified is not found 4 times consecutively
* write java doc documentation for the method above
* feel free to write any helper functions as necessary
* place the following code in your <code>main</code> method to test:

};

System.out.println(checkFour(noConsectiveFour, 1));
System.out.println(checkFour(fourInCol, 1));
System.out.println(checkFour(fourInRow, 1));
System.out.println(checkFour(fourInDiag1, 1));
System.out.println(checkFour(fourInDiag2, 1));
System.out.println(checkFour(fourInDiag3, 1));
System.out.println(checkFour(fourInDiag4, 1));

#### Example Output:

The output should give back -1 for the first board, and 1 for the remainder of the test cases:

## Connect Four Game

#### Overview

Use the method(s) you created in part 1, Four in a Row, to create a Connect Four Game. See the [wikipedia article on Connect Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

#### Setup

* Create a class (<code>.java</code>) file called <code>ConnectFourText.java</code> (and <code>ConnectFourProcessing</code> if you're doing extra credit)
* (This can be within a project that contains the other parts of this homework or it can be in separate project on its own)

#### Features

You can implement this game as:

* a text-only game (15 points) 
* and as a graphical game using processing (an additional 15 points)


__Text Only__

![text only version / console](../resources/img/connect-four-console.gif)

* create a board with 6 rows and 7 columns as shown above (the board can be represented by integers, and displayed as single letters so that you can use the methods you defined in part 1)
* prompt the user to select a column, 0 through 6
* an "X" is placed in the column specified by the user
	* the "X" is placed in the bottom-most row that is not yet occupied by either an "X" or an "O"
* after the player moves: 
	* the board is checked for four consecutive pieces in a row, column or diagonal (using the method or methods you copied over from part 1)
	* if there are consecutive pieces for the player the game ends immediately
* the computer takes a turn by placing a piece on the board
	* the computer's pieces are represented by an "O"
	* you can use any strategy for the computer
	* in the example above, the computer makes a random move
	* the board is checked for a win by the computer
	* if there are consecutive pieces for the computer, the game ends immediately

__Graphical (extra credit)__

![processing](../resources/img/connect-four-processing.gif)

* to submit the extra credit, implement a graphical version of connect four using the instructions below
* __specify which additional features you'll implement__ (see list under part 2)
* the graphical version should follow the same rules as the text version
* (10 points) __Part 1__ - implement these additional requirements
	* the player's pieces are yellow
	* the computer's pieces are blue
	* if the mouse hovers over a column and it is clicked, it is a move for that player
* (5 points) __Part 2__ implement any of these requirements (__specify which one in your assignment submission__)
	* column highlight on mouse hover
	* fade in for the pieces that are just played
	* color fade in for a win

#### Example Output

Additional output for the text-only version:

### Car Animation
 
#### Overview

Create an animation of a car.

#### Setup

* Create a class (<code>.java</code>) file called <code>CarAnimation.java</code>
* (This can be within a project that contains the other parts of this homework or it can be in separate project on its own)

### Features

See example image below. The exact colors and shapes do not have to match; you can be as creative (or as no-frills) as you like.

Use the [example file linked to in the readings](../resources/code/ProcessingDemo.java) to familiarize yourself with methods and variables for drawing and animating shapes.

Implement the following:

* draw a car at the center of the screen
* draw a road
* draw sky
* draw a mountain in the background
	* the mountain should move / be animated
* draw two trees in the background
	* the mountains should move / be animated
* draw lines on the road
	* the lines should move / be animated


#### Example Output
