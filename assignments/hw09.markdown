## (10 points) Practice

### Practice

#### Overview

Create 3 classes, <code>PersonTest</code>, <code><code>Person</code> and <code>Student</code> to demonstrate inheritance. 

#### Setup

* Create the following classes (<code>.java</code> files): 
	* <code>PersonTest</code> 
	* <code>Person</code>
	* <code>Student</code>

* These classes should all be in the same project (and package), so that they have access to each other

#### Requirements

__Person__

1. Create a class called <code>Person</code>
1. Create 4 __private__ member variables (__no member variables should be directly accessible__):
	* <code>first</code>, a <code>String</code>, unique per instance
	* <code>middle</code>, a <code>String</code>, unique per instance
	* <code>last</code>, a <code>String</code>, unique per instance
	* <code>count</code>, an <code>int</code>, a shared value across all instances (_as in_ __static__)
1. Create a _no arg_ constructor for person. Within it:
	* increment <code>count</code>
	* print out <code>"Creating Person #(count)"</code>, where (count) is the value of the count variable
1. Create another constructor that has <code>first</code>, <code>middle</code>, and <code>last</code> as <code>String</code> parameters. Within it:
	* trigger the code to increment the <code>count</code> variable by calling the no arg constructor (<code>this()</code>)
	* call a method called <code>setName</code> (which we'll write next) with the arguments being <code>first</code>, <code>middle</code>, and <code>last</code>...
1. Create a method (with default visibility) called <code>setName</code>. It should not return a value. It should have three <code>String</code> parameters: <code>first</code>, <code>middle</code>, and <code>last</code>. Within it:
	* set all of the member variables based on name
	* (for example <code>this.first = first;</code>)
1. Create a <code>public</code> <code>toString</code> method:
	* the <code>String</code> produced should be: "(first) (middle) (last)"
	* ...where the names inside parentheses represent the member variable values
	* (for example: "Lyndon Baines Johnson")
1. Create getters for all of the member variables (you don't have to create setters, as we will not be using them). Use Eclipse's code generation to do this.
	* In Eclipse, go to:
	* Source &rarr; Generate Getters and Setters (check the appropriate boxes for the setters that you want to create)

__Student__

1. Create a class called <code>Student</code>
1. <code>Student</code> should inherit methods and variables from <code>Person</code> (that is, <code>Student</code> _extends_ <code>Person</code>)
	* __note that private member variables__ from the superclass can still be used
	* ...via getters and setters
1. Create 2 __private__ member variables (__no member variables should be directly accessible__):
	* <code>netId</code>, a <code>String</code>, unique per instance
	* <code>major</code>, a <code>String</code>, unique per instance, that has a default value of <code>"Undeclared"</code>
1. Create a constructor that has <code>first</code>, <code>middle</code>, and <code>last</code> as <code>String</code> parameters. Within it:
	* call the parent class <code>setName</code> with the appropriate arguments
	* call a method called <code>generateNetId</code> (which we'll write later)
	* (note that the parent class constructor will be called automatically in the first line, since we are not explicitly calling it)
1. Create a <code>private</code> method called <code>generateNetId</code>. It should not return a value and it does not have any parameters. Within it:
	* construct a string by...
	* adding the lowercased first letter of the first, middle, and last name together... 
	* (as long as they're not empty and not null)
	* ...and adding the count to it
	* (for example, if the student, <code>"Lyndon Baines Johnson"</code> were the third object created, the net id would be <code>"lbj3"</code>)
1. Create a <code>public</code> method called <code>setNetId</code>. This will allow generated netId to be overwritten. It should not return a value. It should have a single <code>String</code> parameter, <code>netId</code>. 
	* set the <code>netId</code> member variable based on the argument passed in 
	* you can generate this method or manually add it
1. Create an <code>equals</code> method (that overrides <code>Object's</code> <code>equals</code> method). It should be <code>public</code>. It should return a <code>boolean</code>, and it should have a single argument, <code>Object obj</code>.
	* the equals method tests if another object is equal to <code>this</code> object
	* in our implementation, we will assume that if students have the same net id, then they are the same person
	* within the <code>equals</code> method...
	* _exlicitly cast_ <code>obj</code> into a <code>Student</code> object: <code>Student other = (Student) obj;</code>
	* test if <code>other</code>'s <code>NetId</code> is equal to <code>this</code> instance's <code>netId</code>
	* return the resulting <code>boolean</code>
1. Lastly, __override__ the parent class <code>toString</code> method:
	* make sure to add the <code>@Override</code> annotation before your method definition
	* add the <code>netId</code> and <code>major</code> after the first, middle and last name
	* (an easy way to do this is to use the super class <code>toString</code> method: <code>super.toString()</code>)

__Person Test__

* create a <code>main</code> method, the entry point to your program
	* create a new <code>Person</code> object, <code>person</code>: <code>Iam Not Astudent</code>
	* create a new <code>Student</code> object, <code>alice1</code>: <code>Alice Apple Alvarez</code>
	* create a new <code>Student</code> object, <code>alice2</code>: <code>Alice Alma Alvarez</code>
	* print out (variable name) = (string representation of object) for each object above, in the following order: <code>person</code>, <code>alice1</code>, <code>alice2</code>
	* for example, to print out <code>alice2</code>: <code>System.out.printf("alice2 = %s\n", alice2);</code>
	* now, test if <code>alice1</code> and <code>alice2</code> are equal (this should be false, since they have different netIds): <code>System.out.printf("alice1 equals alice2? %s\n", alice1.equals(alice2));</code>
	* change <code>alice2</code>'s <code>netId</code> so that it's the same as <code>alice1</code>'s: <code>"aaa2"</code>
	* print out both <code>alice1</code> and <code>alice2</code> again
	* check if they're equal (the result should be <code>true</code>)
	* lastly, create an <code>Array</code> of <code>People</code> object, composed of the three objects we created: <code>Person[] people = {person, alice1, alice2};</code>
	* notice that there's no compile error... <code>alice1</code> and <code>alice2</code> are considered instances of <code>Person</code>
	* try looping through the <code>Array</code> and printing out each object



#### Example Output

__Your program's output should match the output below__.

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
// the parent class constructor will be called automatically for the last two objects
Creating Person #1
Creating Person #2
Creating Person #3
person = Iam Not Astudent
alice1 = Alice Apple Alvarez aaa2 Undeclared
alice2 = Alice Alma Alvarez aaa3 Undeclared
alice1 equals alice2? false
alice1 = Alice Apple Alvarez aaa2 Undeclared
alice2 = Alice Alma Alvarez aaa2 Undeclared
alice1 equals alice2? true
Iam Not Astudent
Alice Apple Alvarez aaa2 Undeclared
Alice Alma Alvarez aaa2 Undeclared
</code></pre>

## (30 points) Part 2 - Animated Again

### Animated Again

#### Overview

Create an animation, but this time use objects to represent each animated element. You can choose to do an __original__ animation __or__ you can rewrite your <code>CarAnimation</code> homework so that it uses classes and objects.

#### Setup

* Create at least five classes (<code>.java</code> files): 
	* <code>MyAnimation</code> - a processing program with your <code>setup</code> and <code>draw</code> methods
	* __minimally one superclass__ - a class that contains the common member variables and methods that are used in the classes below
	* __minimally three subclasses__ - classes that represent an animated element in your program
* These classes should all be in the same project (and package), so that they have access to each other

#### Features

__General Requirements__

* all animated elements of the program must be instances of classes representing that object
	* for example, a <code>Tree</code> class would be used to create every tree in your animation
* the animated elements must be drawn within their class, not in <code>MyAnimation</code>
	* that is, all of the calls to drawing shapes, such as <code>ellipse</code> and <code>rect</code> should be in the class of the element being drawn 
	* for example <code>Tree</code> should know how to draw itself
	* ...using a <code>PApplet</code> passed in from its constructor
	* (see [example code under the Resources/Sample Code section](#resources))
* additionally, you should able to add objects with key presses (minimally two objects)
	* use the keys 'm' and 't' to trigger adding additional objects to your animation
	* for example, in the animation below, key presses add mountains and trees
	* (see [example code for handling keypresses under the Resources/Sample Code section](#resources))
	* each object should be drawn in a different random location
	* use the <code>Random</code> class and <code>nextInt</code>, <code>nextFloat</code> or <code>nextDouble</code> methods
	* __each newly created object should vary in size__
	* __each newly created object should vary in color or shade__
	* __use an <code>ArrayList</code> to store multiple objects__
	* an <code>ArrayList</code> is a dynamically sized Array that you can add and remove elements from
* __find all of the common member variables ane methods of your objects__... and create a superclass
	* place variables and methods in the superclass that all of your subclasses can use (for example, the <code>PApplet</code> variable, <code>_p</code>)
	* all of your other objects should inherit from this superclass
* implementation requirements
	* (see [example code for ArrayLists under the Resources/Sample Code section](#resources))
	* use <code>super</code> at least once to call a super class constructor
	* __override__ at least one method... make sure to use the @override annotation!

<a name="resources"></a>

#### Resources / Code Samples

__About Drawing__

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
import processing.core.PApplet;

/**
 * This program demonstrates an aggregation relationship between
 * an object being drawn and a PApplet instance. The object being drawn
 * uses its own PApplet instance to render itself. See the comments
 * below.
 */
public class MyAnimation extends PApplet{
	Circle c;
	public void setup() {
		// pass in *this* PApplet instance to circle so that it can draw
		// itself!
		c = new Circle(this);
	}
	
	public void draw() {
		background(0);
		c.move();
		c.render();
	}
}

class Circle {
	int diameter = 30;
	float y = -diameter / 2;
	
	private PApplet _p;
	
	Circle(PApplet _p) {
		this._p = _p;
	}
	
	// the circle knows how to move itself...
	public void move() {
		this.y += 1.5;
		if (this.y > _p.width + diameter / 2) {
			this.y = -diameter / 2;
		}
	}
	
	// the circle also knows how to draw itself...
	// notice that the _p member variable can be used to call all of the
	// familiar processing methods that we know, such as ellipse, rect, etc.
    // ... it can even access the width of a sketch
	public void render() {
		_p.noStroke();
		_p.ellipse(_p.width / 2, y, diameter, diameter);
	}
}
</code></pre>

__Detecting Key Presses__

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
import java.util.Random;
import processing.core.PApplet;

/**
 * This program will change the location of a circle whenever the key, 'c',
 * is pressed. See the comments below regarding detecting key presses.
 */
public class KeysPlease extends PApplet{
	Random rng = new Random();
	int x;
	
	public void setup() {
		x = rng.nextInt(width);
	}

	public void draw() {
		background(0);
		ellipse(x, height / 2, 20, 20);
	}
	
	// Define a keyPressed method that gets called whenever a key is pressed.
	// You can check for specific keys by looking at the value in the variable,
	// key.
	public void keyPressed() {
		if (key == 'c') {
			x = rng.nextInt(width);
		}
	}
}

</code></pre>

__Using ArrayLists__

(Please read section 11.11 in {{ site.book }} on <code>ArrayList</code>)


<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
import java.util.ArrayList;

/**
 * This program will create a list of cities that dynamically grows by
 * adding new elements. This uses the ArrayList class.
 */

public class UsingArrayList {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// the type that your array list will contain goes in the "angle brackets"
		ArrayList&lt;String&gt; cities = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
		cities.add("Albany");
		cities.add("Ithaca");
		cities.add("Rochester");
		for(String city: cities) {
			System.out.println(city);
		}
	}
}

</code></pre>

#### Example Output

The example below shows mountains and trees being added to the animation as the user presses the keys <code>m</code> and <code>t</code>:

<div markdown="block" class="img">
![alt](../resources/img/animation3.gif)
</div>
