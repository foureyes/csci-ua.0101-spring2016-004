__Prerequisite:__ Introduction to Computer Programming (CSCI-UA 2) or departmental permission assessed by placement exam. 

__Description:__ Students learn how to design algorithms to solve problems and how to translate these algorithms into working computer programs. Experience is acquired through programming projects in a high level programming language. CSCI-UA 101 is intended as a first course for computer science majors, and for students of other scientific disciplines. Programming assignments.

* The assignment will stay open up to 24 hours in NYU classes
	* After the 24 hour grace period, homework cannot be submitted
	* A pattern of late homework will result in zero points for the next late homework (even if submitted within he 24 hour grace period)
* Please read the [page on academic integrity](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity)
	* You can help fellow students debug or discuss high-level algorithms
	* __But write your own code!__
	* That means, don't copy other students' work, solutions found online, etc.
	* (seriously - there's [automated software that detects plagiarism](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/))
