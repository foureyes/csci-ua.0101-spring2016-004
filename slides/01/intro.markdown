## Nice to Meet You

__Some things about you__...

* {:.fragment} have some prior programming experience (but not too much)
* {:.fragment} or... you've taken 0002, Introduction to _Computer Programming_
* {:.fragment} if you took the AP Computer Science exam in high school, you may consider placing out
	* 3, you place out and take 102
	* 4 or 5, you place out __and__ you automatically get credit for course

# About This Course 

</section>
<section markdown="block">
## Course Description

__This course is intended to be the first course for computer science majors, or the second for minors__

By the end of this course, you should:

* have a good understanding of fundamental programming concepts (you should already have this!)
* be comfortable writing small-to-medium programs in Java
* be able to design algorithms to solve problems - and translate those algorithms to working programs
* have an understanding of object-oriented programming
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Topics

__Sooo... what exactly are we covering?__

There are three main parts to the course:

* Introduction to Java / Basic Programming Review
* Object Oriented Programming
* Additional Topics

(We'll be following our textbook pretty closely, with the exception of some the material in _Additional Topics_)

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Introduction to Java / Basic Programming Review

__You'll likely be somewhat familiar with the first part of the course (read as _not too hard_)__:

* Primitive Data Types
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Methods
* Arrays / Multi-Dimensional Arrays

Note that we will be using __Java__, which is quite different from Python... so moving from Python to Java will likely be more challenging than the actual concepts above!

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Object Oriented Programming 

__New-ish material - _slightly_ more difficult than the basic topics__:

* Classes
* Objects
* Strings
* Objected Oriented Program Design
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstract Classes, Interfaces

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Additional Topics 

__And, finally, some fun stuff__:

* Basic Graphics Programming
	* __this calls for a demo or two!__ &rarr;
* File I/O
* Recursion
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Compared to Intro to Programming (0002)

__It's a bit more difficult than 0002!__

* {:.fragment} material __before the 1st midterm__ exam should be __familiar__ 
* {:.fragment} after that, all new (perhaps _more difficult_) material
* {:.fragment} homework grading will take into account __program design__ and __efficiency__
* {:.fragment} if you're not comfortable with topics from 0002, or if your grade were on the lower side (C, B-), you may consider working with me during office hours / __going to tutors from the start__

<span class="fragment">(Lastly, this is the first time teaching I'm teaching this particular course so it might be a little rough around the edges!)</span>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Logistics

We meet here, in {{ site.course_room }} on {{ site.course_time }}

* __Official Course Title:__ {{ site.course_name }}
* __Course Number and Section:__ {{ site.course_number }}-{{ site.course_section }}

<span class="fragment">Oh - also... you should know that I occasionally take attendance.</span>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Grading

__We'll have 2 midterms and a final__:

* 25% - Homework
* 20% - Midterm #1
* 20% - Midterm #2
* 35% - Final Exam
* __consistent attendance__ will bump your grade up if you're on the border
* (obviously, lack of attendance will have the opposite effect)

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Homework

__About one homework every week__:

* Turned in __electronically__ via __NYU Classes__
* Usually __due one week after posting__
* 24 hour grace period, after which __homework submissions are not accepted__ 
* A pattern of homework being submitted during the grace period will result in point penalties
* Read the [page on academic integrity](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/academic_integrity)
	* You can help fellow students debug or discuss high-level algorithms
	* __But write your own code!__ (don't copy other students' work or solutions found online)
	* Seriously - there's [software that detects plagiarism](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/))

## This Site, These Slides

I'll send out this info as well... but for now:

* you can find my courses at [cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/](http://cs.nyu.edu/~jversoza/)
* (or go directly to [http://foureyes.github.io/csci-ua.0101-spring2015-004/](http://foureyes.github.io/csci-ua.0101-spring2015-004/))
* these slides were built with [reveal.js](http://revealjs.com/) for HTML/CSS slides
	* use arrow keys to navigate
	* (or click on arrow buttons)
	* add <code>?print-pdf</code> to url to get the [one page version](intro.html?print-pdf)
</section>

## Oh Yes - We Also Have a Book

As I mentioned before, we'll be following our textbook fairly closely.

__Introduction to Java Programming__, Brief Version, 10th Edition - By Y. Daniel Liang

* [Book details from the publisher's site](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/cs-resources/products/product.html#product,isbn=0133813487)
* The comprehensive edition is NOT needed for this course (though you may consider getting it if you're planning on taking Data Structures)
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Today's Topics

We'll cover:

* hardware/software/programming languages
* an intro to Java, and hello world, of course, in Java
* using Eclipse, an IDE
* primitive data types
* numeric operations
* some built in methods (functions)
* user input
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## But Before All of That, a Survey

* who took 0002 (Intro to Computer Programming)?
* who's written some Java before?
* who done _Object Oriented Programming_?

(__aaaand a hand-out__ &rarr;)
