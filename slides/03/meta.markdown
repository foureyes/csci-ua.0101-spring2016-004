## Homework #1

__Oops!__

Everything (of course, by _everything_, I mean the assignment itself as well as NYU Classes) says that the assignment is due today, February 3rd at 11PM.

* however, my email mentioned the 5th as the due date
* I expect assignments to be turned in this evening
* if you were relying on the 5th as the actual due date, send me a note; I'll give extensions individually
