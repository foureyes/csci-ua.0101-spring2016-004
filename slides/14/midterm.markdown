## Midterm #1, Augmenting Exam Scores 

* there is __no curve__ (average was right on, median was high)
* however, there will be an opportunity on the 2nd exam to recover from a low scoring 1st exam...
	* {:.fragment} if you some percentage better (10% most likely) on the second exam
	* {:.fragment} I will weight it more than the 1st (maybe something like %10 for the 1st, %20 for the second)
	* {:.fragment} (rather than 20/20)
	* {:.fragment} will not work in the opposite direction (if your 1st is higher than your second, this will no be applied)
	* {:.fragment} I'll send out the full details when they're finalized
