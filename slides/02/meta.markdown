<section markdown="block">
## Today's Topics

* a short review + filling in some gaps
* a quick exercise
* on coercion, casting, checking for NaN and undefined, 
* functions
* perhaps another quick exercise
* maybe objects
* maybe a git crash course to prep for next week

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Where This Fits in With Everything Else

* check out the [schedule](../../schedule.html)
* we're doing about 3 weeks of JavaScript
* for the first week, we're covering the basics (a bit of a drag, I know)
* next week, we're covering the _fun stuff_ - like functional programming and object oriented programming

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Homework

* nothing to turn in this week; I just expected you to try installing node
* ...and maybe do some reading
* __you did get my email, right? all 256 of them?__ (sorry about that)
* first assignment will be posted on Tuesday next week
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Miscellaneous

* I'll let you know the results from the survey next Tuesday as well
* __has everyone been able to get to the class slides?__ &rarr;
* __what about NYU classes?__ &rarr;
* __have you tried reading {{ site.book_js }}? Good? Not so good?__ &rarr;

## Concerned About Not Knowing HTML/CSS?

Here are some resources:

* [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) by Shay Howe
* [Make a Website](http://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-a-website) by Codecademy

<br>
Both are free and online... and relatively compact!

(though... I know from surveys that some of you are __actually literally professionals__ with regard to this topic!)

<section markdown="block">
## Onward!

### Again, the topics we'll check out today are:

* a short review + filling in some gaps
* a quick exercise
* on coercion, casting, checking for NaN and undefined, 
* functions
* perhaps another quick exercise
* maybe objects
* maybe a git crash course to prep for next week
